Yes, there are SWF files that take ROMs. As of now, I have emulators for NES, SNES, Gameboy (color), GBA (Gameboy Advance) as well as Sega Genesis. Now, for obvious reasons, I cannot and will not include regular ROMs. You will have to get those on your own. 

The main thing of interest with these emulators are the fact that you can essentially "inject" a ROM into the .SWF and you can play the ROM from the .SWF. Of course, there's little point in this today considering we have way better emulators for the [NES](https://fceux.com/web/download.html), [SNES](https://www.snes9x.com/default.asp), [Gameboy](https://digiex.net/threads/tgb-dual-vol-8-3-1-english-download-gameboy-emulator-with-link-cable-support.14666/) and so on. You can even emulate these on a mobile phone. For the Android users, you don't even need to look outside of the Play Store. As for the Apple folk, they don't need to worry, they can use an emulator like [Eclipse](https://eclipseemu.me/play/) for free through their web browser.

So, what's the point in these? Honestly, there isn't really a real point, since these emulators are quite outdated. However, these still do exist, and it is quite nice that you can literally just inject a ROM into it and be done. Sure, it's pointless, but just remember that we have smartass programmers who run the first person shooter DOOM on quite literally everything from [printers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPWi5yJK3zo) to a [literal pregnancy test](https://twitter.com/foone/status/1302820468819288066?lang=en)

So, what's included? Obviously, as said earlier, I am not going to provide retail ROMs, so everything inside the emulators consist of nothing more than homebrew applications that I found somewhere. They are compatible with retail games, but you will have to find them yourself.

I cannot in good faith redistribute the emulators as I originally found them, as all but 1 came with a copyrighted ROM (the only exception is the Gameboy emulator, which came with The Bouncing Ball). The NES one came with a Japanese copy of Contra. The Genesis one came with a copy of Super Shinobi, and so on. For obvious reasons, I had to change these to free homebrew applications so I wouldn't get DMCA notices filed against me. However, I have tested a small amount of games, and even ROM hacks still work nicely. I've tested the popular ROM hack [Pokémon Crystal Clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQYBsZ78fdI), Earthbound, Super Castlevania 4, Sonic the Hedgehog (including a hack allowing the player to spindash), Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal as well as Emerald, Contra 3 - The Alien Wars and Castlevania: Dracula X. All of them have worked great. There were minor issues, but nothing that's impossible to work with (aside from the fact that I'm trash at old and hard games).
